Hey! I'm Krut Patel. Welcome to my little corner of the internet!

Having graduated from the University of Illinois with a Masters in CS (Spring 2025), I am now working at Nvidia as a compiler engineer with the CUDA team. HMU if you are in the Puget Sound area!

Prior to this, I was a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), building a native query execution engine for accelerating Big Data queries using Just-In-Time compilation.

I love pushing the boundaries of computing performance, and am always exploring the fields of Compilers, Databases and Computer Systems.

Much of my time is spent browsing [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and automating all the repetitive stuff using [Python scripts](https://github.com/iamkroot/misc-scripts/).

## My Reading Activity

I am an avid reader and primarily enjoy speculative fiction. [Ted Chiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Chiang) is my favourite author; everyone should read [The Great Silence](https://nautil.us/the-great-silence-237510/) at least once a year!

The following Github-style graph shows the time devoted to reading novels on a daily basis. Extracted from [Moon+ Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flyersoft.moonreader) using [moonreader-py](https://github.com/iamkroot/moonreader-py).
