Hey! I'm Krut Patel. Welcome to my little corner of the internet!

I am currently pursuing a MS CS degree from UIUC. Prior to this, I was a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), building a native query execution engine for accelerating Big Data queries using Just-In-Time compilation. Previously, I interned with the [DIAS Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dias/) at EPFL, Switzerland, where I developed a scalable CSV Parser in a JIT-compiled OLAP database system.

I love pushing the boundaries of computing performance, and am exploring the fields of Compilers, Databases and Computer Systems.

Much of my time is spent browsing [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and automating all the repetitive stuff using [Python scripts](https://github.com/iamkroot/misc-scripts/).

## My Reading Activity

I am an avid reader and primarily enjoy speculative fiction. [Ted Chiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Chiang) is my favourite author; everyone should read [The Great Silence](https://nautil.us/the-great-silence-237510/) at least once a year!

The following Github-style graph shows the time devoted to reading novels on a daily basis. Extracted from [Moon+ Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flyersoft.moonreader) using [moonreader-py](https://github.com/iamkroot/moonreader-py).
