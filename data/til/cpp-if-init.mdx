title: 'C++17 can do variable initialization inside `if` conditions'

This is a totally valid C++ program:

```cpp
if (auto it = m.find(10); it != m.end())
    return it->second.size();
```

Note the two parts of the `if` condition separated by a `;`. The first part initializes the variable, and  is the actual condition to be checked.

Benefits include limiting the scope of the initialized variable to the `if` body.

This has interesting implications when used with RAII:

```cpp
if (std::lock_guard lock(mx); shared_flag) {
    unsafe_ping();
    shared_flag = false;
}
```

The above code ensures the mutex `mx` is only locked for the body of the `if`.
