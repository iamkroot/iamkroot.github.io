This seems obvious, but it took me \~5 years of using the terminal to realize that I can use <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> to _undo_ my latest edit. And it works repeatedly, unlike yank!

Credits to an offhand comment at the end of a [StackExchange answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/665470/417994) about mashing too many <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>w</kbd>s to delete words.
