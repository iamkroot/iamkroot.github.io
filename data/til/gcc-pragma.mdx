The `#pragma` is meant to allow the programmer to give hints to the compiler, which can then do "implementation-specific" things. Well, `gcc` maintainers took this literally — on seeing this directive in a `C` file, the compiler would stop compiling, and attempt to run a game!

> The "#pragma" command is specified in the ANSI standard to have an arbitrary implementation- defined effect. In the GNU C preprocessor, "#pragma" first attempts to run the game "rogue"; if that fails, it tries to run the game "hack"; if that fails, it tries to run GNU Emacs displaying the Tower of Hanoi; if that fails, it reports a fatal error. In any case, preprocessing does not continue.
