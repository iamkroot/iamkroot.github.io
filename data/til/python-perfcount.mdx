[`time.perf_counter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.perf_counter) provides access to the highest available resolution clock to measure a short duration. Been available since Python 3.3!

And its more accurate counterpart [`time.perf_counter_ns`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.perf_counter_ns) which returns an `int` was added in Python 3.7.
