CMake has a... unique approach to booleans. Any value that ends with `-NOTFOUND` evaluates to `False`.

> False if the constant is 0, OFF, NO, FALSE, N, IGNORE, NOTFOUND, the empty string, or ends in the suffix -NOTFOUND.

- [CMake docs](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.27/command/if.html#constant)

```cmake
set(some_var xyz-NOTFOUND)
if(NOT some_var)
    message(STATUS "It's-a me, falsio!")
endif()
```
