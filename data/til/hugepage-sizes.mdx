Modern CPU architectures support memory pages larger than the traditional 4KB sizes. For x86-64, they show up as 2MB and 1GB pages. This is a by-product of the multi-level paging scheme used in virtual memory today.

Virtual page numbers are `9` bits each and each page table entry uses `8` bytes. So each page table itself fits on a 4K page (9-bits + 3-bits = 12-bits).

4K pages use the last 12 bits (literally, 2^12 = 4K) to offset into the page.

The 2MB hugepage uses the last 21 bits, essentially using up the last page table too.
