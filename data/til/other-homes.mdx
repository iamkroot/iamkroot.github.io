We know that `~` is `$HOME`, but it is more general than this. Usually, `~foo` will expand to `/home/foo`, but could be anything as configured in `/etc/passwd`.

_Very_ handy when dealing with multiple users.

There's even more expansions like `~+/foo` and `~-N`. See [Bash manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Tilde-Expansion.html) for further info.

PS: This trick even works in Firefox!
