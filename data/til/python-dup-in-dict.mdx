Lemma 1: You can override `__hash__` for any object.

Lemma 2: You can also override the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods.

Combine these two, and you can end up in a situation like this-
```python
...
>>> mydict
{"a": 1, "b": 2, "a": 3}  # notice something funny?
```

Behind the scenes, we have _two_ `a` objects, each with a different hash, but with the same stringified value (`"a"`). This issue becomes particularly relevant when using dataclasses with inheritance:

```python
@dataclass(unsafe_hash=True)
class FunkyStr:
    val: str
    def __repr__(self):
        return self.val

@dataclass(unsafe_hash=True, repr=False)
class SubclassStr(FunkyStr):
    # no extra members, all I wanted
    pass

mydict = {FunkyStr("a"): 1, FunkyStr("b"): 2, SubclassStr("a"): 3}
print(mydict)  # gives {"a": 1, "b": 2, "a": 3}
```

Both the `a` objects have different hashes because they are instances of different classes. The real title of this post could have been- Python hashing is [nominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system), not structural! (but that's not clickbait-y enough)

To be honest - in the above example, the real crime is abusing `__repr__` to return the internal value. See [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__) for correct usage.
