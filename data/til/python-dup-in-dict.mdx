Lemma 1: You can override `__hash__` for any object.

Lemma 2: You can also override the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods.

Combine these two, and you can end up in a situation like this-
```python
...
>>> mydict
{"a": 1, "b": 2, "a": 3}  # notice something funny?
```

Behind the scenes, we have _two_ `a` objects, each with a different hash, but with the same stringified value (`"a"`).

This one bit me as I was wading chest deep through the debugging session of a bug.
